# XenServer Builder (from an ISO)

Type: `xenserver-iso`

The XenServer Packer builder is able to create [XenServer](https://www.xenserver.org/)
virtual machines and export them either as an XVA or a VDI and create VM templates starting from an ISO image.

The builder builds a virtual machine by creating a new virtual machine
from scratch, booting it, installing an OS, provisioning software within
the OS, then shutting it down. The result of the XenServer builder is a
directory containing all the files necessary to run the virtual machine
portably.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. In addition to
the items listed here, you will want to look at the general configuration
references for [HTTP](#http-directory-configuration),
[Floppy](#floppy-configuration),
[Boot](#boot-configuration),
[Shutdown](#shutdown-configuration),
[Communicator](#communicator-configuration)
configuration references, which are
necessary for this build to succeed and can be found further down the page.
